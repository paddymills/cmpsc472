# Least recently used
- stack algorithm
- throw out last used
- stylistically, we re-order stack to show last used
- Perfect LRU is expensive, because we need a register to keep track of last used timestamp

## Matrix impl
$$\text{n page frames} \rightarrow n*n\text{ bit matrix}$$
- if frame *k* is referenced, h/w sets all bits of row *k* to 1 and all the bits of column *k* to 0
- row with lowest binary value is LRE

# Simple clock algorithm
1) add *use* bit for each frame
2) when page is loaded, set use bit = 1
3) when a page is referenced, set use bit = 1
4) all possible victims form a circular buffer with a pointer (clock hand)
5) when a page is referenced, set ptr to next frame
6) to replace a page
	1) scan buffer for use bit == 0
	2) if use bit == 1, set bit to 0 and advance
	3) if found, it is victim
	4) if all bits are 1, it makes one complete cycle and stops at the original position

# Modified clock algorithm
- add a modify bit (dirty bit) meaning page has been change
- give 4 page categories
	- use=0, modify=0: best victim
	- use=1, modify=0
	- use=0, modify=1
	- use=1, modify=1: worst victim
- same algorithm, except
	- try to find (0,0), without changing use bits
	- else, scan again looking for (0,1), changing use bits to 0
	- else, repeat scan for (0,0)
		- could just repeat for (0,1), because there is a chance the scan for (0,0) is still fruitless
