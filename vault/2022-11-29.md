# Combine Paging & Segmentation
- Divide segments into pages
- Page table for each segment
- logical address: [segment|page|offset]
## example
- virtual address
	- 2-bit segment
	- 2-bit page #
	- 10-big offset
- main memory: 8192 bytes (2^13)

- segment 1
	- read only
	- page table [VirtPage, PageFrame]
		- 0: 2
		- 1: 1
		- 2: 6
		- 3: on disk
- segment 2
	- read, write, exec
	- page table not in memory
- segment 3
	- read, exec
	-  page table [VirtPage, PageFrame]
		- 0: disk
		- 1: 0
		- 2: 5
		- 3: 4
- segment 4
	- read, write
	-  page table [VirtPage, PageFrame]
		- 0: disk
		- 1: 3
		- 2: disk
		- 3: 7

| Access     | Segement | Page# | Offset | PhysicalAddr(decimal) |
| ---------- | -------- | ----- | ------ | --------------------- |
| fetch data | 0        | 3     | 25     | Page Fault            |
| fetch      | 3        | 1     | 1      | $$2^{10}*3+1=3073$$   |
| store data | 2        | 3     | 2      | Protection fault      |
| jump to    | 0        | 0     | 50     | Segment fault         |


# Memory Management Software

1) use virtual memory?
2) paging, segmentation or both?
3) Algoirthms
	1) fetch policy (when do we handle page fault)
		- demand: get at page fault
		- prepaging
	2) placement policy
	3) replacement policy
	4) resident set mgmt
		- are # pages fixed or variable
		- replacement local or global (scope)
	5) cleaning policy
		- demand
		- pre-cleaning
	6) load control

*assume only using paging*

## Replacement algorithms

## Optimal
- select page for which the next referece is the longest into future
- used as benchmark
 example
	- page reference string: 7 0 1 2 0 3 0 4 2 3 0 2
| 7   | 0   | 1   | 2   | 0   | 3   | 0   | 4   | 2   | 3   | 0   | 2   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 7   | 0   | 1   | 1   | -   | 3   | -   | 3   | -   | -   | 0   | -   |
|     | 7   | 0   | 0   | -   | 0   | -   | 4   | -   | -   | 4   | -   |
|     |     | 7   | 2   | -   | 2   | -   | 2   | -   | -   | 2   | -    |
| PF  | PF  | PF  | PF  |     | PF  |     | PF  |     |     | PF  |     |

## Random
## FIFO
| 7   | 0   | 1   | 2   | 0   | 3   | 0   | 4   | 2   | 3   | 0   | 2   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 7   | 0   | 1   | 2   | -   | 3   | 0   | 4   | 2   | 3   | 0   | -   |
|     | 7   | 0   | 1   | -   | 2   | 3   | -   | 4   | 2   | 3   | -   |
|     |     | 7   | 0   | -   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 0   | 4   | 2   | -   |
