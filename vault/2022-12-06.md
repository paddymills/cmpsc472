# IO

> [!info] 3 techniques
> 1) Programmed I/O
> 2) Interrupt Driven I/O
> 3) DMA (**D**irect **M**emory **A**ccess) - external module handles I/O

*scan - moving read head*
*seek time - time to scan*
*latency (rotational delay) - time to turn disk*
*transfer time - time to get from I/O device to CPU*
$$\text{access time} = seek + latency$$

## Seek time

Typical: 1-30ms

n = number of tracks
m = constant(dependent on drive)
s = startup time
b = bytes

$$\text{Seek Time} T_s=m*n+S$$


$$\text{Transfer Time: }T = \frac b{rN}$$

$$\text{Total Access Time: }T_a = T_s + \frac 12 r + \frac b {rN}$$

### example 1
- Disk:
	- avg seek: 20ms
	- transfer rate: 1mb/s
	- 512 byte sectors
	- 32 sectors/track
	- 3600 rpm
- Read file of 256 sectors (128k bytes)

#### 1) file is stored on 8 adjacent tracks
1st track:
- avg seek: 20ms
- rotational delay: 8.3ms
- read 32 sectors:
$$1 \frac{mb}{sec} = 1,048,576 \frac{bytes}{sec} = 1048.57 \frac{bytes}{ms}$$
$$\text{32 sectors} = 2^5*2^9=2^{14}=16,384 \text{ bytes}$$
$$\frac {16,384}{1048.57} = 15.6\text{ ms}$$
remaining tracks:
- no seek time
- each successive track costs
$$8.3+15.6=23.9\text{ ms}$$

$$\text{To read entire file: 43.9 ms} + 7*(23.9ms)=211.2ms=0.2112seconds$$
#### 2) stored randomly
*each sector must be accessed individually*
for each sector:
- avg seek: 20ms
- rotational delay: 8.3ms
- read 1 sectors:
	- 0.5ms (roughly half prev example)
	- 28.8ms per sector
$$256*28.8=7373ms=7.373seconds$$

## example 2
- avg seek: 10ms
- rotation speed: 10k rpm
- 512 byte sectors
- 320 sectors/track
- transfer tim is unknown
*read a file of 2560 sectors (1.3MB)*

calculated rotational dealy: 3ms
calculated rev-per-sec: 166.7

1) 8 sectors contiguously
read 320 sectors

$$T=\frac{b}{rN} = \frac {163840}{166.7*163840} = 0.006s = 6\text{ms per track}$$
to read 320 sectors: 6ms
total to read 1st track: 10ms + 3ms + 6ms = 19ms

19+7(9) = 82ms

2) random: each sector
read 1 sector: .01875 = 13.187ms & 2560 = 33.3sec

# Disk Scheduling

reqs: 98,183,37,122,14,124,65,67 (head at 53)

1) FIFO
2) SSTF (Shortest-Seek-Time-First)
3) Scan- move back and forth, reversing direction when it hits the end
4) Circular Scan - Scan, except always in same direction

# File Management

## Access Modes
- Sequential
- Direct
- Indexed
## Storage
- contiguous
- linked list
- indexed
## File Allocation
- Contiguous
	- fast access
	- suffers from external fragmentation
	- suffers performance when adding to middle of file
- Linked list
	- list of (possibly variable size) blocks
	- fixes external fragmentation issue
	- suffers from access performance
- Indexed
	- Maintains a directory to index file block locations
	- used by Unix

## Unix Inodes
- Inode table
	- contains file information (name, created, modified, access, ...)
	- structure
		- File control block (mode, link count, ownerID, groupID, Filesize, timestamps)
		- direct blocks index (usually 12 pointers to data blocks)
		- single indirect (pointer to a table of 2048 pointers to data blocks)
		- double indirect (pointer to a table of 2048 pointers to a table of 2048 pointers to data blocks)
		- triple indirect (...)
